# Keycloak Docker image

Example Dockerfile with Keycloak server.

## Usage

To boot in standalone mode

    docker run jboss/keycloak

## Creating admin account

By default there is no admin user created so you won't be able to login to the admin console. To create an admin account you need to use environment variables to pass in an initial username and password. This is done by running:

    docker run -e KEYCLOAK_USER=<USERNAME> -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD> jboss/keycloak

You can also create an account on an already running container by running:

    docker exec <CONTAINER> keycloak/bin/add-user-keycloak.sh -u <USERNAME> -p <PASSWORD>

Then restarting the container:

    docker restart <CONTAINER>


### Specify log level

When starting the Keycloak instance you can pass a number an environment variables to set log level for Keycloak, for example:

    docker run -e KEYCLOAK_LOGLEVEL=DEBUG jboss/keycloak
